They swear by Allah to you [Muslims] to satisfy you. But Allah and His Messenger are more worthy for them to satisfy, if they should be believers. Do they not know that whoever opposes Allah and His Messenger - that for him is the fire of Hell, wherein he will abide eternally? That is the great disgrace. They hypocrites are apprehensive lest a surah be revealed about them, informing them of what is in their hearts. Say, \"Mock [as you wish]; indeed, Allah will expose that which you fear.\" And if you ask them, they will surely say, \"We were only conversing and playing.\" Say, \"Is it Allah and His verses and His Messenger that you were mocking?\" Make no excuse; you have disbelieved after your belief. If We pardon one faction of you - We will punish another faction because they were criminals. The hypocrite men and hypocrite women are of one another. They enjoin what is wrong and forbid what is right and close their hands. They have forgotten Allah, so He has forgotten them [accordingly]. Indeed, the hypocrites - it is they who are the defiantly disobedient. Allah has promised the hypocrite men and hypocrite women and the disbelievers the fire of Hell, wherein they will abide eternally. It is sufficient for them. And Allah has cursed them, and for them is an enduring punishment. [You disbelievers are] like those before you; they were stronger than you in power and more abundant in wealth and children. They enjoyed their portion [of worldly enjoyment], and you have enjoyed your portion as those before you enjoyed their portion, and you have engaged [in vanities] like that in which they engaged. [It is] those whose deeds have become worthless in this world and in the Hereafter, and it is they who are the losers. Has there not reached them the news of those before them - the people of Noah and [the tribes of] 'Aad and Thamud and the people of Abraham and the companions of Madyan and the towns overturned? Their messengers came to them with clear proofs. And Allah would never have wronged them, but they were wronging themselves. ","surah":9,"ayah":"61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70"},{"verses":"O Prophet, fight against the disbelievers and the hypocrites and be harsh upon them. And their refuge is Hell, and wretched is the destination. They swear by Allah that they did not say [anything against the Prophet] while they had said the word of disbelief and disbelieved after their [pretense of] Islam and planned that which they were not to attain. And they were not resentful except [for the fact] that Allah and His Messenger had enriched them of His bounty. So if they repent, it is better for them; but if they turn away, Allah will punish them with a painful punishment in this world and the Hereafter. And there will not be for them on earth any protector or helper. And among them are those who made a covenant with Allah, [saying], \"If He should give us from His bounty, we will surely spend in charity, and we will surely be among the righteous.\" But when he gave them from His bounty, they were stingy with it and turned away while they refused. So He penalized them with hypocrisy in their hearts until the Day they will meet Him - because they failed Allah in what they promised Him and because they [habitually] used to lie. Did they not know that Allah knows their secrets and their private conversations and that Allah is the Knower of the unseen? Those who criticize the contributors among the believers concerning [their] charities and [criticize] the ones who find nothing [to spend] except their effort, so they ridicule them - Allah will ridicule them, and they will have a painful punishment. Ask forgiveness for them, [O Muhammad], or do not ask forgiveness for them. If you should ask forgiveness for them seventy times - never will Allah forgive them. That is because they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger, and Allah does not guide the defiantly disobedient people. Those who remained behind rejoiced in their staying [at home] after [the departure of] the Messenger of Allah and disliked to strive with their wealth and their lives in the cause of Allah and said, \"Do not go forth in the heat.\" Say, \"The fire of Hell is more intensive in heat\" - if they would but understand. So let them laugh a little and [then] weep much as recompense for what they used to earn. If Allah should return you to a faction of them [after the expedition] and then they ask your permission to go out [to battle], say, \"You will not go out with me, ever, and you will never fight with me an enemy. Indeed, you were satisfied with sitting [at home] the first time, so sit [now] with those who stay behind.\" And do not pray [the funeral prayer, O Muhammad], over any of them who has died - ever - or stand at his grave. Indeed, they disbelieved in Allah and His Messenger and died while they were defiantly disobedient. And let not their wealth and their children impress you. Allah only intends to punish them through them in this world and that their souls should depart [at death] while they are disbelievers. And when a surah was revealed [enjoining them] to believe in Allah and to fight with His Messenger, those of wealth among them asked your permission [to stay back] and said, \"Leave us to be with them who sit [at home].\" They were satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and their hearts were sealed over, so they do not understand. But the Messenger and those who believed with him fought with their wealth and their lives. Those will have [all that is] good, and it is those who are the successful. Allah has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide eternally. That is the great attainment. And those with excuses among the bedouins came to be permitted [to remain], and they who had lied to Allah and His Messenger sat [at home]. There will strike those who disbelieved among them a painful punishment. There is not upon the weak or upon the ill or upon those who do not find anything to spend any discomfort when they are sincere to Allah and His Messenger. There is not upon the doers of good any cause [for blame]. And Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Nor [is there blame] upon those who, when they came to you that you might give them mounts, you said, \"I can find nothing for you to ride upon.\" They turned back while their eyes overflowed with tears out of grief that they could not find something to spend [for the cause of Allah]. The cause [for blame] is only upon those who ask permission of you while they are rich. They are satisfied to be with those who stay behind, and Allah has sealed over their hearts, so they do not know. They will make excuses to you when you have returned to them. Say, \"Make no excuse - never will we believe you. Allah has already informed us of your news. And Allah will observe your deeds, and [so will] His Messenger; then you will be taken back to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.\" They will swear by Allah to you when you return to them that you would leave them alone. So leave them alone; indeed they are evil; and their refuge is Hell as recompense for what they had been earning. They swear to you so that you might be satisfied with them. But if you should be satisfied with them - indeed, Allah is not satisfied with a defiantly disobedient people. The bedouins are stronger in disbelief and hypocrisy and more likely not to know the limits of what [laws] Allah has revealed to His Messenger. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And among the bedouins are some who consider what they spend as a loss and await for you turns of misfortune. Upon them will be a misfortune of evil. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. But among the bedouins are some who believe in Allah and the Last Day and consider what they spend as means of nearness to Allah and of [obtaining] invocations of the Messenger. Unquestionably, it is a means of nearness for them. Allah will admit them to His mercy. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. And the first forerunners [in the faith] among the Muhajireen and the Ansar and those who followed them with good conduct - Allah is pleased with them and they are pleased with Him, and He has prepared for them gardens beneath which rivers flow, wherein they will abide forever. That is the great attainment. And among those around you of the bedouins are hypocrites, and [also] from the people of Madinah. They have become accustomed to hypocrisy. You, [O Muhammad], do not know them, [but] We know them. We will punish them twice [in this world]; then they will be returned to a great punishment. And [there are] others who have acknowledged their sins. They had mixed a righteous deed with another that was bad. Perhaps Allah will turn to them in forgiveness. Indeed, Allah is Forgiving and Merciful. Take, [O, Muhammad], from their wealth a charity by which you purify them and cause them increase, and invoke [Allah 's blessings] upon them. Indeed, your invocations are reassurance for them. And Allah is Hearing and Knowing. Do they not know that it is Allah who accepts repentance from His servants and receives charities and that it is Allah who is the Accepting of repentance, the Merciful? And say, \"Do [as you will], for Allah will see your deeds, and [so, will] His Messenger and the believers. And you will be returned to the Knower of the unseen and the witnessed, and He will inform you of what you used to do.\" And [there are] others deferred until the command of Allah - whether He will punish them or whether He will forgive them. And Allah is Knowing and Wise. And [there are] those [hypocrites] who took for themselves a mosque for causing harm and disbelief and division among the believers and as a station for whoever had warred against Allah and His Messenger before. And they will surely swear, \"We intended only the best.\" And Allah testifies that indeed they are liars. Do not stand [for prayer] within it - ever. A mosque founded on righteousness from the first day is more worthy for you to stand in. Within it are men who love to purify themselves; and Allah loves those who purify themselves. Then is one who laid the foundation of his building on righteousness [with fear] from Allah and [seeking] His approval better or one who laid the foundation of his building on the edge of a bank about to collapse, so it collapsed with him into the fire of Hell? And Allah does not guide the wrongdoing people. Their building which they built will not cease to be a [cause of] skepticism in their hearts until their hearts are stopped. And Allah is Knowing and Wise.

Indeed Satan, to man, is a manifest enemy. And thus will your Lord choose you and teach you the interpretation of narratives and complete His favor upon you and upon the family of Jacob, as He completed it upon your fathers before, Abraham and Isaac.

Indeed, our father is in clear error. Kill Joseph or cast him out to [another] land; the countenance of your father will [then] be only for you, and you will be after that a righteous people.\" Said a speaker among them, \"Do not kill Joseph but throw him into the bottom of the well; some travelers will pick him up - if you would do [something].\" They said, \"O our father, why do you not entrust us with Joseph while indeed, we are to him sincere counselors? Send him with us tomorrow that he may eat well and play. And indeed, we will be his guardians. [Jacob] said, \"Indeed, it saddens me that you should take him, and I fear that a wolf would eat him while you are of him unaware.\" They said, \"If a wolf should eat him while we are a [strong] clan, indeed, we would then be losers.\" So when they took him [out] and agreed to put him into the bottom of the well... But We inspired to him, \"You will surely inform them [someday] about this affair of theirs while they do not perceive [your identity].\" And they came to their father at night, weeping. They said, \"O our father, indeed we went racing each other and left Joseph with our possessions, and a wolf ate him. But you would not believe us, even if we were truthful.\" And they brought upon his shirt false blood. [Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. And Allah is the one sought for help against that which you describe.\" And there came a company of travelers; then they sent their water drawer, and he let down his bucket. He said, \"Good news! Here is a boy.\" And they concealed him, [taking him] as merchandise; and Allah was knowing of what they did. And they sold him for a reduced price - a few dirhams - and they were, concerning him, of those content with little. And the one from Egypt who bought him said to his wife, \"Make his residence comfortable. Perhaps he will benefit us, or we will adopt him as a son.\" And thus, We established Joseph in the land that We might teach him the interpretation of events. And Allah is predominant over His affair, but most of the people do not know. And when Joseph reached maturity, We gave him judgment and knowledge. And thus We reward the doers of good. And she, in whose house he was, sought to seduce him. She closed the doors and said, \"Come, you.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allah. Indeed, he is my master, who has made good my residence. Indeed, wrongdoers will not succeed.\" And she certainly determined [to seduce] him, and he would have inclined to her had he not seen the proof of his Lord. And thus [it was] that We should avert from him evil and immorality. Indeed, he was of Our chosen servants. And they both raced to the door, and she tore his shirt from the back, and they found her husband at the door. She said, \"What is the recompense of one who intended evil for your wife but that he be imprisoned or a painful punishment?\" [Joseph] said, \"It was she who sought to seduce me.\" And a witness from her family testified. \"If his shirt is torn from the front, then she has told the truth, and he is of the liars. But if his shirt is torn from the back, then she has lied, and he is of the truthful.\" So when her husband saw his shirt torn from the back, he said, \"Indeed, it is of the women's plan. Indeed, your plan is great. Joseph, ignore this. And, [my wife], ask forgiveness for your sin. Indeed, you were of the sinful.\" And women in the city said, \"The wife of al-'Azeez is seeking to seduce her slave boy; he has impassioned her with love. Indeed, we see her [to be] in clear error.\" So when she heard of their scheming, she sent for them and prepared for them a banquet and gave each one of them a knife and said [to Joseph], \"Come out before them.\" And when they saw him, they greatly admired him and cut their hands and said, \"Perfect is Allah! This is not a man; this is none but a noble angel.\" She said, \"That is the one about whom you blamed me. And I certainly sought to seduce him, but he firmly refused; and if he will not do what I order him, he will surely be imprisoned and will be of those debased.\" He said, \"My Lord, prison is more to my liking than that to which they invite me. And if You do not avert from me their plan, I might incline toward them and [thus] be of the ignorant.\" So his Lord responded to him and averted from him their plan. Indeed, He is the Hearing, the Knowing. Then it appeared to them after they had seen the signs that al-'Azeez should surely imprison him for a time. And there entered the prison with him two young men. One of them said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself [in a dream] pressing wine.\" The other said, \"Indeed, I have seen myself carrying upon my head [some] bread, from which the birds were eating. Inform us of its interpretation; indeed, we see you to be of those who do good.\" He said, \"You will not receive food that is provided to you except that I will inform you of its interpretation before it comes to you. That is from what my Lord has taught me. Indeed, I have left the religion of a people who do not believe in Allah, and they, in the Hereafter, are disbelievers. And I have followed the religion of my fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. And it was not for us to associate anything with Allah. That is from the favor of Allah upon us and upon the people, but most of the people are not grateful. O [my] two companions of prison, are separate lords better or Allah, the One, the Prevailing? You worship not besides Him except [mere] names you have named them, you and your fathers, for which Allah has sent down no authority. Legislation is not but for Allah. He has commanded that you worship not except Him. That is the correct religion, but most of the people do not know. O two companions of prison, as for one of you, he will give drink to his master of wine; but as for the other, he will be crucified, and the birds will eat from his head. The matter has been decreed about which you both inquire.\" And he said to the one whom he knew would go free, \"Mention me before your master.\" But Satan made him forget the mention [to] his master, and Joseph remained in prison several years. And [subsequently] the king said, \"Indeed, I have seen [in a dream] seven fat cows being eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry. O eminent ones, explain to me my vision, if you should interpret visions.\" They said, \"[It is but] a mixture of false dreams, and we are not learned in the interpretation of dreams.\" But the one who was freed and remembered after a time said, \"I will inform you of its interpretation, so send me forth.\" [He said], \"Joseph, O man of truth, explain to us about seven fat cows eaten by seven [that were] lean, and seven green spikes [of grain] and others [that were] dry - that I may return to the people; perhaps they will know [about you].\" [Joseph] said, \"You will plant for seven years consecutively; and what you harvest leave in its spikes, except a little from which you will eat. Then will come after that seven difficult [years] which will consume what you saved for them, except a little from which you will store. Then will come after that a year in which the people will be given rain and in which they will press [olives and grapes].\" And the king said, \"Bring him to me.\" But when the messenger came to him, [Joseph] said, \"Return to your master and ask him what is the case of the women who cut their hands. Indeed, my Lord is Knowing of their plan.\" Said [the king to the women], \"What was your condition when you sought to seduce Joseph?\" They said, \"Perfect is Allah! We know about him no evil.\" The wife of al-'Azeez said, \"Now the truth has become evident. It was I who sought to seduce him, and indeed, he is of the truthful. That is so al-'Azeez will know that I did not betray him in [his] absence and that Allah does not guide the plan of betrayers. And I do not acquit myself. Indeed, the soul is a persistent enjoiner of evil, except those upon which my Lord has mercy. Indeed, my Lord is Forgiving and Merciful.\" And the king said, \"Bring him to me; I will appoint him exclusively for myself.\" And when he spoke to him, he said, \"Indeed, you are today established [in position] and trusted.\" [Joseph] said, \"Appoint me over the storehouses of the land. Indeed, I will be a knowing guardian.\" And thus We established Joseph in the land to settle therein wherever he willed. We touch with Our mercy whom We will, and We do not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good. And the reward of the Hereafter is better for those who believed and were fearing Allah. And the brothers of Joseph came [seeking food], and they entered upon him; and he recognized them, but he was to them unknown. And when he had furnished them with their supplies, he said, \"Bring me a brother of yours from your father. Do not you see that I give full measure and that I am the best of accommodators? But if you do not bring him to me, no measure will there be [hereafter] for you from me, nor will you approach me.\" They said, \"We will attempt to dissuade his father from [keeping] him, and indeed, we will do [it].\" And [Joseph] said to his servants, \"Put their merchandise into their saddlebags so they might recognize it when they have gone back to their people that perhaps they will [again] return.\" So when they returned to their father, they said, \"O our father, [further] measure has been denied to us, so send with us our brother [that] we will be given measure. And indeed, we will be his guardians.\" He said, \"Should I entrust you with him except [under coercion] as I entrusted you with his brother before? But Allah is the best guardian, and He is the most merciful of the merciful.\" And when they opened their baggage, they found their merchandise returned to them. They said, \"O our father, what [more] could we desire? This is our merchandise returned to us. And we will obtain supplies for our family and protect our brother and obtain an increase of a camel's load; that is an easy measurement.\" [Jacob] said, \"Never will I send him with you until you give me a promise by Allah that you will bring him [back] to me, unless you should be surrounded by enemies.\" And when they had given their promise, he said, \"Allah, over what we say, is Witness.\" And he said, \"O my sons, do not enter from one gate but enter from different gates; and I cannot avail you against [the decree of] Allah at all. The decision is only for Allah; upon Him I have relied, and upon Him let those who would rely [indeed] rely.\" And when they entered from where their father had ordered them, it did not avail them against Allah at all except [it was] a need within the soul of Jacob, which he satisfied. And indeed, he was a possessor of knowledge because of what We had taught him, but most of the people do not know. And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his brother to himself; he said, \"Indeed, I am your brother, so do not despair over what they used to do [to me].\" So when he had furnished them with their supplies, he put the [gold measuring] bowl into the bag of his brother. Then an announcer called out, \"O caravan, indeed you are thieves.\" They said while approaching them, \"What is it you are missing?\" They said, \"We are missing the measure of the king. And for he who produces it is [the reward of] a camel's load, and I am responsible for it.\" They said, \"By Allah, you have certainly known that we did not come to cause corruption in the land, and we have not been thieves.\" The accusers said, \"Then what would be its recompense if you should be liars?\" [The brothers] said, \"Its recompense is that he in whose bag it is found - he [himself] will be its recompense. Thus do we recompense the wrongdoers.\" So he began [the search] with their bags before the bag of his brother; then he extracted it from the bag of his brother. Thus did We plan for Joseph. He could not have taken his brother within the religion of the king except that Allah willed. We raise in degrees whom We will, but over every possessor of knowledge is one [more] knowing. They said, \"If he steals - a brother of his has stolen before.\" But Joseph kept it within himself and did not reveal it to them. He said, \"You are worse in position, and Allah is most knowing of what you describe.\" They said, \"O 'Azeez, indeed he has a father [who is] an old man, so take one of us in place of him. Indeed, we see you as a doer of good.\" He said, \"[I seek] the refuge of Allah [to prevent] that we take except him with whom we found our possession. Indeed, we would then be unjust.\" So when they had despaired of him, they secluded themselves in private consultation. The eldest of them said, \"Do you not know that your father has taken upon you an oath by Allah and [that] before you failed in [your duty to] Joseph? So I will never leave [this] land until my father permits me or Allah decides for me, and He is the best of judges. Return to your father and say, \"O our father, indeed your son has stolen, and we did not testify except to what we knew. And we were not witnesses of the unseen, And ask the city in which we were and the caravan in which we came - and indeed, we are truthful,\" [Jacob] said, \"Rather, your souls have enticed you to something, so patience is most fitting. Perhaps Allah will bring them to me all together. Indeed it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise.\" And he turned away from them and said, \"Oh, my sorrow over Joseph,\" and his eyes became white from grief, for he was [of that] a suppressor. They said, \"By Allah, you will not cease remembering Joseph until you become fatally ill or become of those who perish.\" He said, \"I only complain of my suffering and my grief to Allah, and I know from Allah that which you do not know. O my sons, go and find out about Joseph and his brother and despair not of relief from Allah. Indeed, no one despairs of relief from Allah except the disbelieving people.\" So when they entered upon Joseph, they said, \"O 'Azeez, adversity has touched us and our family, and we have come with goods poor in quality, but give us full measure and be charitable to us. Indeed, Allah rewards the charitable.\" He said, \"Do you know what you did with Joseph and his brother when you were ignorant?\" They said, \"Are you indeed Joseph?\" He said \"I am Joseph, and this is my brother. Allah has certainly favored us. Indeed, he who fears Allah and is patient, then indeed, Allah does not allow to be lost the reward of those who do good.\" They said, \"By Allah, certainly has Allah preferred you over us, and indeed, we have been sinners.\" He said, \"No blame will there be upon you today. Allah will forgive you; and He is the most merciful of the merciful.\" Take this, my shirt, and cast it over the face of my father; he will become seeing. And bring me your family, all together.\" And when the caravan departed [from Egypt], their father said, \"Indeed, I find the smell of Joseph [and would say that he was alive] if you did not think me weakened in mind.\" They said, \"By Allah, indeed you are in your [same] old error.\" And when the bearer of good tidings arrived, he cast it over his face, and he returned [once again] seeing. He said, \"Did I not tell you that I know from Allah that which you do not know?\" They said, \"O our father, ask for us forgiveness of our sins; indeed, we have been sinners.\" He said, \"I will ask forgiveness for you from my Lord. Indeed, it is He who is the Forgiving, the Merciful.\" And when they entered upon Joseph, he took his parents to himself and said, \"Enter Egypt, Allah willing, safe [and secure].\" And he raised his parents upon the throne, and they bowed to him in prostration. And he said, \"O my father, this is the explanation of my vision of before. My Lord has made it reality. And He was certainly good to me when He took me out of prison and brought you [here] from bedouin life after Satan had induced [estrangement] between me and my brothers. Indeed, my Lord is Subtle in what He wills. Indeed, it is He who is the Knowing, the Wise. My Lord, You have given me [something] of sovereignty and taught me of the interpretation of dreams. Creator of the heavens and earth, You are my protector in this world and in the Hereafter.

And when the punishment descended upon them, they said, \"O Moses, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. If you [can] remove the punishment from us, we will surely believe you, and we will send with you the Children of Israel.\" But when We removed the punishment from them until a term which they were to reach, then at once they broke their word. So We took retribution from them, and We drowned them in the sea because they denied Our signs and were heedless of them. And We caused the people who had been oppressed to inherit the eastern regions of the land and the western ones, which We had blessed. And the good word of your Lord was fulfilled for the Children of Israel because of what they had patiently endured. And We destroyed [all] that Pharaoh and his people were producing and what they had been building. And We took the Children of Israel across the sea; then they came upon a people intent in devotion to [some] idols of theirs. They said, \"O Moses, make for us a god just as they have gods.\" He said, \"Indeed, you are a people behaving ignorantly. Indeed, those [worshippers] - destroyed is that in which they are [engaged], and worthless is whatever they were doing.\" He said, \"Is it other than Allah I should desire for you as a god while He has preferred you over the worlds?\" And [recall, O Children of Israel], when We saved you from the people of Pharaoh, [who were] afflicting you with the worst torment - killing your sons and keeping your women alive. And in that was a great trial from your Lord. And We made an appointment with Moses for thirty nights and perfected them by [the addition of] ten; so the term of his Lord was completed as forty nights. And Moses said to his brother Aaron, \"Take my place among my people, do right [by them], and do not follow the way of the corrupters.\" And when Moses arrived at Our appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said, \"My Lord, show me [Yourself] that I may look at You.\" [Allah] said, \"You will not see Me, but look at the mountain; if it should remain in place, then you will see Me.\" But when his Lord appeared to the mountain, He rendered it level, and Moses fell unconscious. And when he awoke, he said, \"Exalted are You! I have repented to You, and I am the first of the believers.\" [Allah] said, \"O Moses, I have chosen you over the people with My messages and My words [to you]. So take what I have given you and be among the grateful.\" And We wrote for him on the tablets [something] of all things - instruction and explanation for all things, [saying], \"Take them with determination and order your people to take the best of it. I will show you the home of the defiantly disobedient.\" I will turn away from My signs those who are arrogant upon the earth without right; and if they should see every sign, they will not believe in it. And if they see the way of consciousness, they will not adopt it as a way; but if they see the way of error, they will adopt it as a way. That is because they have denied Our signs and they were heedless of them. Those who denied Our signs and the meeting of the Hereafter - their deeds have become worthless. Are they recompensed except for what they used to do? And the people of Moses made, after [his departure], from their ornaments a calf - an image having a lowing sound. Did they not see that it could neither speak to them nor guide them to a way? They took it [for worship], and they were wrongdoers. And when regret overcame them and they saw that they had gone astray, they said, \"If our Lord does not have mercy upon us and forgive us, we will surely be among the losers.\" And when Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved, he said, \"How wretched is that by which you have replaced me after [my departure]. Were you impatient over the matter of your Lord?\" And he threw down the tablets and seized his brother by [the hair of] his head, pulling him toward him. [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, indeed the people oppressed me and were about to kill me, so let not the enemies rejoice over me and do not place me among the wrongdoing people.\" [Moses] said, \"My Lord, forgive me and my brother and admit us into Your mercy, for You are the most merciful of the merciful.\" Indeed, those who took the calf [for worship] will obtain anger from their Lord and humiliation in the life of this world, and thus do We recompense the inventors [of falsehood]. But those who committed misdeeds and then repented after them and believed - indeed your Lord, thereafter, is Forgiving and Merciful. And when the anger subsided in Moses, he took up the tablets; and in their inscription was guidance and mercy for those who are fearful of their Lord. And Moses chose from his people seventy men for Our appointment. And when the earthquake seized them, he said, \"My Lord, if You had willed, You could have destroyed them before and me [as well]. Would You destroy us for what the foolish among us have done? This is not but Your trial by which You send astray whom You will and guide whom You will. You are our Protector, so forgive us and have mercy upon us; and You are the best of forgivers. And decree for us in this world [that which is] good and [also] in the Hereafter; indeed, we have turned back to You.\" [Allah] said, \"My punishment - I afflict with it whom I will, but My mercy encompasses all things.\" So I will decree it [especially] for those who fear Me and give zakah and those who believe in Our verses - Those who follow the Messenger, the unlettered prophet, whom they find written in what they have of the Torah and the Gospel, who enjoins upon them what is right and forbids them what is wrong and makes lawful for them the good things and prohibits for them the evil and relieves them of their burden and the shackles which were upon them. So they who have believed in him, honored him, supported him and followed the light which was sent down with him - it is those who will be the successful. Say, [O Muhammad], \"O mankind, indeed I am the Messenger of Allah to you all, [from Him] to whom belongs the dominion of the heavens and the earth. There is no deity except Him; He gives life and causes death.\" So believe in Allah and His Messenger, the unlettered prophet, who believes in Allah and His words, and follow him that you may be guided. And among the people of Moses is a community which guides by truth and by it establishes justice. And We divided them into twelve descendant tribes [as distinct] nations. And We inspired to Moses when his people implored him for water, \"Strike with your staff the stone,\" and there gushed forth from it twelve springs. Every people knew its watering place. And We shaded them with clouds and sent down upon them manna and quails, [saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you.\" And they wronged Us not, but they were [only] wronging themselves. And [mention, O Muhammad], when it was said to them, \"Dwell in this city and eat from it wherever you will and say, 'Relieve us of our burdens,' and enter the gate bowing humbly; We will [then] forgive you your sins. We will increase the doers of good [in goodness and reward].\" But those who wronged among them changed [the words] to a statement other than that which had been said to them. So We sent upon them a punishment from the sky for the wrong that they were doing.

Is this magic? But magicians will not succeed.\" They said, \"Have you come to us to turn us away from that upon which we found our fathers and so that you two may have grandeur in the land? And we are not believers in you.\" And Pharaoh said, \"Bring to me every learned magician.\" So when the magicians came, Moses said to them, \"Throw down whatever you will throw.\" And when they had thrown, Moses said, \"What you have brought is [only] magic. Indeed, Allah will expose its worthlessness. Indeed, Allah does not amend the work of corrupters.

Our Lord, make us not [objects of] trial for the wrongdoing people And save us by Your mercy from the disbelieving people.\" And We inspired to Moses and his brother, \"Settle your people in Egypt in houses and make your houses [facing the] qiblah and establish prayer and give good tidings to the believers.\" And Moses said, \"Our Lord, indeed You have given Pharaoh and his establishment splendor and wealth in the worldly life, our Lord, that they may lead [men] astray from Your way. Our Lord, obliterate their wealth and harden their hearts so that they will not believe until they see the painful punishment.\" [Allah] said, \"Your supplication has been answered.\" So remain on a right course and follow not the way of those who do not know.\" And We took the Children of Israel across the sea, and Pharaoh and his soldiers pursued them in tyranny and enmity until, when drowning overtook him, he said, \"I believe that there is no deity except that in whom the Children of Israel believe, and I am of the Muslims.\" Now? And you had disobeyed [Him] before and were of the corrupters? So today We will save you in body that you may be to those who succeed you a sign.

So when they had passed beyond it, [Moses] said to his boy, \"Bring us our morning meal. We have certainly suffered in this, our journey, [much] fatigue.\" He said, \"Did you see when we retired to the rock? Indeed, I forgot [there] the fish. And none made me forget it except Satan - that I should mention it. And it took its course into the sea amazingly\". [Moses] said, \"That is what we were seeking.\" So they returned, following their footprints. And they found a servant from among Our servants to whom we had given mercy from us and had taught him from Us a [certain] knowledge. Moses said to him, \"May I follow you on [the condition] that you teach me from what you have been taught of sound judgement?\" He said, \"Indeed, with me you will never be able to have patience. And how can you have patience for what you do not encompass in knowledge?\" [Moses] said, \"You will find me, if Allah wills, patient, and I will not disobey you in [any] order.\" He said, \"Then if you follow me, do not ask me about anything until I make to you about it mention.\" So they set out, until when they had embarked on the ship, al-Khidh r tore it open. [Moses] said, \"Have you torn it open to drown its people? You have certainly done a grave thing.\" [Al-Khidh r] said, \"Did I not say that with me you would never be able to have patience?\" [Moses] said, \"Do not blame me for what I forgot and do not cover me in my matter with difficulty.\" So they set out, until when they met a boy, al-Khidh r killed him.

You have obtained from me an excuse.\" So they set out, until when they came to the people of a town, they asked its people for food, but they refused to offer them hospitality. And they found therein a wall about to collapse, so al-Khidh r restored it. [Moses] said, \"If you wished, you could have taken for it a payment.\" [Al-Khidh r] said, \"This is parting between me and you. I will inform you of the interpretation of that about which you could not have patience. As for the ship, it belonged to poor people working at sea. So I intended to cause defect in it as there was after them a king who seized every [good] ship by force. And as for the boy, his parents were believers, and we feared that he would overburden them by transgression and disbelief. So we intended that their Lord should substitute for them one better than him in purity and nearer to mercy. And as for the wall, it belonged to two orphan boys in the city, and there was beneath it a treasure for them, and their father had been righteous.

Indeed, you are in the sacred valley of Tuwa. And I have chosen you, so listen to what is revealed [to you]. Indeed, I am Allah. There is no deity except Me, so worship Me and establish prayer for My remembrance. Indeed, the Hour is coming - I almost conceal it - so that every soul may be recompensed according to that for which it strives. So do not let one avert you from it who does not believe in it and follows his desire, for you [then] would perish. And what is that in your right hand, O Moses?\" He said, \"It is my staff; I lean upon it, and I bring down leaves for my sheep and I have therein other uses.\" [Allah] said, \"Throw it down, O Moses.\" So he threw it down, and thereupon it was a snake, moving swiftly. [Allah] said, \"Seize it and fear not; We will return it to its former condition. And draw in your hand to your side; it will come out white without disease - another sign, That We may show you [some] of Our greater signs. Go to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed.\" [Moses] said, \"My Lord, expand for me my breast [with assurance] And ease for me my task And untie the knot from my tongue That they may understand my speech. And appoint for me a minister from my family - Aaron, my brother. Increase through him my strength And let him share my task That we may exalt You much And remember You much. Indeed, You are of us ever Seeing.\" [Allah] said, \"You have been granted your request, O Moses. And We had already conferred favor upon you another time, When We inspired to your mother what We inspired, [Saying], 'Cast him into the chest and cast it into the river, and the river will throw it onto the bank; there will take him an enemy to Me and an enemy to him.' And I bestowed upon you love from Me that you would be brought up under My eye. [And We favored you] when your sister went and said, 'Shall I direct you to someone who will be responsible for him?' So We restored you to your mother that she might be content and not grieve. And you killed someone, but We saved you from retaliation and tried you with a [severe] trial. And you remained [some] years among the people of Madyan. Then you came [here] at the decreed time, O Moses. And I produced you for Myself. Go, you and your brother, with My signs and do not slacken in My remembrance. Go, both of you, to Pharaoh. Indeed, he has transgressed. And speak to him with gentle speech that perhaps he may be reminded or fear [Allah].\" They said, \"Our Lord, indeed we are afraid that he will hasten [punishment] against us or that he will transgress.\" [Allah] said, \"Fear not. Indeed, I am with you both; I hear and I see. So go to him and say, 'Indeed, we are messengers of your Lord, so send with us the Children of Israel and do not torment them. We have come to you with a sign from your Lord. And peace will be upon he who follows the guidance. Indeed, it has been revealed to us that the punishment will be upon whoever denies and turns away.' \" [Pharaoh] said, \"So who is the Lord of you two, O Moses?\" He said, \"Our Lord is He who gave each thing its form and then guided [it].\" [Pharaoh] said, \"Then what is the case of the former generations?\" [Moses] said, \"The knowledge thereof is with my Lord in a record. My Lord neither errs nor forgets.\" [It is He] who has made for you the earth as a bed [spread out] and inserted therein for you roadways and sent down from the sky, rain and produced thereby categories of various plants. Eat [therefrom] and pasture your livestock. Indeed, in that are signs for those of intelligence. From the earth We created you, and into it We will return you, and from it We will extract you another time. And We certainly showed Pharaoh Our signs - all of them - but he denied and refused. He said, \"Have you come to us to drive us out of our land with your magic, O Moses? Then we will surely bring you magic like it, so make between us and you an appointment, which we will not fail to keep and neither will you, in a place assigned.\" [Moses] said, \"Your appointment is on the day of the festival when the people assemble at mid-morning.\" So Pharaoh went away, put together his plan, and then came [to Moses]. Moses said to the magicians summoned by Pharaoh, \"Woe to you! Do not invent a lie against Allah or He will exterminate you with a punishment; and he has failed who invents [such falsehood].\" So they disputed over their affair among themselves and concealed their private conversation. They said, \"Indeed, these are two magicians who want to drive you out of your land with their magic and do away with your most exemplary way. So resolve upon your plan and then come [forward] in line. And he has succeeded today who overcomes.\" They said, \"O Moses, either you throw or we will be the first to throw.\" He said, \"Rather, you throw.\" And suddenly their ropes and staffs seemed to him from their magic that they were moving [like snakes]. And he sensed within himself apprehension, did Moses. Allah said, \"Fear not. Indeed, it is you who are superior. And throw what is in your right hand; it will swallow up what they have crafted. What they have crafted is but the trick of a magician, and the magician will not succeed wherever he is.\" So the magicians fell down in prostration. They said, \"We have believed in the Lord of Aaron and Moses.\" [Pharaoh] said, \"You believed him before I gave you permission. Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic. So I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will crucify you on the trunks of palm trees, and you will surely know which of us is more severe in [giving] punishment and more enduring.\" They said, \"Never will we prefer you over what has come to us of clear proofs and [over] He who created us. So decree whatever you are to decree. You can only decree for this worldly life. Indeed, we have believed in our Lord that He may forgive us our sins and what you compelled us [to do] of magic. And Allah is better and more enduring.\" Indeed, whoever comes to his Lord as a criminal - indeed, for him is Hell; he will neither die therein nor live. But whoever comes to Him as a believer having done righteous deeds - for those will be the highest degrees [in position]: Gardens of perpetual residence beneath which rivers flow, wherein they abide eternally. And that is the reward of one who purifies himself. And We had inspired to Moses, \"Travel by night with My servants and strike for them a dry path through the sea; you will not fear being overtaken [by Pharaoh] nor be afraid [of drowning].\" So Pharaoh pursued them with his soldiers, and there covered them from the sea that which covered them, And Pharaoh led his people astray and did not guide [them]. O Children of Israel, We delivered you from your enemy, and We made an appointment with you at the right side of the mount, and We sent down to you manna and quails, [Saying], \"Eat from the good things with which We have provided you and do not transgress [or oppress others] therein, lest My anger should descend upon you. And he upon whom My anger descends has certainly fallen.\" But indeed, I am the Perpetual Forgiver of whoever repents and believes and does righteousness and then continues in guidance. [Allah] said, \"And what made you hasten from your people, O Moses?\" He said, \"They are close upon my tracks, and I hastened to You, my Lord, that You be pleased.\" [Allah] said, \"But indeed, We have tried your people after you [departed], and the Samiri has led them astray.\" So Moses returned to his people, angry and grieved. He said, \"O my people, did your Lord not make you a good promise? Then, was the time [of its fulfillment] too long for you, or did you wish that wrath from your Lord descend upon you, so you broke your promise [of obedience] to me?\" They said, \"We did not break our promise to you by our will, but we were made to carry burdens from the ornaments of the people [of Pharaoh], so we threw them [into the fire], and thus did the Samiri throw.\" And he extracted for them [the statue of] a calf which had a lowing sound, and they said, \"This is your god and the god of Moses, but he forgot.\" Did they not see that it could not return to them any speech and that it did not possess for them any harm or benefit? And Aaron had already told them before [the return of Moses], \"O my people, you are only being tested by it, and indeed, your Lord is the Most Merciful, so follow me and obey my order.\" They said, \"We will never cease being devoted to the calf until Moses returns to us.\" [Moses] said, \"O Aaron, what prevented you, when you saw them going astray, From following me? Then have you disobeyed my order?\" [Aaron] said, \"O son of my mother, do not seize [me] by my beard or by my head. Indeed, I feared that you would say, 'You caused division among the Children of Israel, and you did not observe [or await] my word.' \" [Moses] said, \"And what is your case, O Samiri?\" He said, \"I saw what they did not see, so I took a handful [of dust] from the track of the messenger and threw it, and thus did my soul entice me.\" [Moses] said, \"Then go. And indeed, it is [decreed] for you in [this] life to say, 'No contact.' And indeed, you have an appointment [in the Hereafter] you will not fail to keep.

Indeed, he is your leader who has taught you magic, but you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides, and I will surely crucify you all.\" They said, \"No harm. Indeed, to our Lord we will return. Indeed, we aspire that our Lord will forgive us our sins because we were the first of the believers.\" And We inspired to Moses, \"Travel by night with My servants; indeed, you will be pursued.\" Then Pharaoh sent among the cities gatherers [And said], \"Indeed, those are but a small band, And indeed, they are enraging us, And indeed, we are a cautious society... \" So We removed them from gardens and springs And treasures and honorable station - Thus. And We caused to inherit it the Children of Israel. So they pursued them at sunrise. And when the two companies saw one another, the companions of Moses said, \"Indeed, we are to be overtaken!\" [Moses] said, \"No! Indeed, with me is my Lord; He will guide me.\" Then We inspired to Moses, \"Strike with your staff the sea,\" and it parted, and each portion was like a great towering mountain. And We advanced thereto the pursuers. And We saved Moses and those with him, all together. Then We drowned the others.

Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters. And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared. And We inspired to the mother of Moses, \"Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers.\" And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners. And the wife of Pharaoh said, \"[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they perceived not. And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers. And she said to his sister, \"Follow him\"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not. And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, \"Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?\" So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of the people do not know. And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good. And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy. And the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, \"This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy.\" He said, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me,\" and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, \"My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals.\" And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure], when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him [once again]. Moses said to him, \"Indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator.\" And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, \"O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders.\" And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, \"O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors.\" So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, \"My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.\" And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way.\" And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, \"What is your circumstance?\" They said, \"We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.\" So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, \"My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.\" Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, \"Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.\" So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, \"Fear not. You have escaped from the wrongdoing people.\" One of the women said, \"O my father, hire him. Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.\" He said, \"Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.\" [Moses] said, \"That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and Allah, over what we say, is Witness.\" And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, \"Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.\" But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree, \"O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds.\" And [he was told], \"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], \"O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure. Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient.\" He said, \"My Lord, indeed, I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me. And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.\" [Allah] said, \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant.\" But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, \"This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers.\" And Moses said, \"My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home. Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed.\" And Pharaoh said, \"O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars.\" And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us. So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wrongdoers. And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised. And We gave Moses the Scripture, after We had destroyed the former generations, as enlightenment for the people and guidance and mercy that they might be reminded.

And he drew out his hand; thereupon it was white [with radiance] for the observers. Said the eminent among the people of Pharaoh, \"Indeed, this is a learned magician Who wants to expel you from your land [through magic], so what do you instruct?\" They said, \"Postpone [the matter of] him and his brother and send among the cities gatherers Who will bring you every learned magician.\" And the magicians came to Pharaoh. They said, \"Indeed for us is a reward if we are the predominant.\" He said, \"Yes, and, [moreover], you will be among those made near [to me].\" They said, \"O Moses, either you throw [your staff], or we will be the ones to throw [first].\" He said, \"Throw,\" and when they threw, they bewitched the eyes of the people and struck terror into them, and they presented a great [feat of] magic. And We inspired to Moses, \"Throw your staff,\" and at once it devoured what they were falsifying. So the truth was established, and abolished was what they were doing. And Pharaoh and his people were overcome right there and became debased. And the magicians fell down in prostration [to Allah]. They said, \"We have believed in the Lord of the worlds, The Lord of Moses and Aaron.\" Said Pharaoh, \"You believed in him before I gave you permission. Indeed, this is a conspiracy which you conspired in the city to expel therefrom its people. But you are going to know. I will surely cut off your hands and your feet on opposite sides; then I will surely crucify you all.\" They said, \"Indeed, to our Lord we will return.

Indeed, Pharaoh exalted himself in the land and made its people into factions, oppressing a sector among them, slaughtering their [newborn] sons and keeping their females alive. Indeed, he was of the corrupters. And We wanted to confer favor upon those who were oppressed in the land and make them leaders and make them inheritors And establish them in the land and show Pharaoh and [his minister] Haman and their soldiers through them that which they had feared. And We inspired to the mother of Moses, \"Suckle him; but when you fear for him, cast him into the river and do not fear and do not grieve. Indeed, We will return him to you and will make him [one] of the messengers.\" And the family of Pharaoh picked him up [out of the river] so that he would become to them an enemy and a [cause of] grief. Indeed, Pharaoh and Haman and their soldiers were deliberate sinners. And the wife of Pharaoh said, \"[He will be] a comfort of the eye for me and for you. Do not kill him; perhaps he may benefit us, or we may adopt him as a son.\" And they perceived not. And the heart of Moses' mother became empty [of all else]. She was about to disclose [the matter concerning] him had We not bound fast her heart that she would be of the believers. And she said to his sister, \"Follow him\"; so she watched him from a distance while they perceived not. And We had prevented from him [all] wet nurses before, so she said, \"Shall I direct you to a household that will be responsible for him for you while they are to him [for his upbringing] sincere?\" So We restored him to his mother that she might be content and not grieve and that she would know that the promise of Allah is true. But most of the people do not know. And when he attained his full strength and was [mentally] mature, We bestowed upon him judgement and knowledge. And thus do We reward the doers of good. And he entered the city at a time of inattention by its people and found therein two men fighting: one from his faction and one from among his enemy. And the one from his faction called for help to him against the one from his enemy, so Moses struck him and [unintentionally] killed him. [Moses] said, \"This is from the work of Satan. Indeed, he is a manifest, misleading enemy.\" He said, \"My Lord, indeed I have wronged myself, so forgive me,\" and He forgave him. Indeed, He is the Forgiving, the Merciful. He said, \"My Lord, for the favor You bestowed upon me, I will never be an assistant to the criminals.\" And he became inside the city fearful and anticipating [exposure], when suddenly the one who sought his help the previous day cried out to him [once again]. Moses said to him, \"Indeed, you are an evident, [persistent] deviator.\" And when he wanted to strike the one who was an enemy to both of them, he said, \"O Moses, do you intend to kill me as you killed someone yesterday? You only want to be a tyrant in the land and do not want to be of the amenders.\" And a man came from the farthest end of the city, running. He said, \"O Moses, indeed the eminent ones are conferring over you [intending] to kill you, so leave [the city]; indeed, I am to you of the sincere advisors.\" So he left it, fearful and anticipating [apprehension]. He said, \"My Lord, save me from the wrongdoing people.\" And when he directed himself toward Madyan, he said, \"Perhaps my Lord will guide me to the sound way.\" And when he came to the well of Madyan, he found there a crowd of people watering [their flocks], and he found aside from them two women driving back [their flocks]. He said, \"What is your circumstance?\" They said, \"We do not water until the shepherds dispatch [their flocks]; and our father is an old man.\" So he watered [their flocks] for them; then he went back to the shade and said, \"My Lord, indeed I am, for whatever good You would send down to me, in need.\" Then one of the two women came to him walking with shyness. She said, \"Indeed, my father invites you that he may reward you for having watered for us.\" So when he came to him and related to him the story, he said, \"Fear not.

Indeed, the best one you can hire is the strong and the trustworthy.\" He said, \"Indeed, I wish to wed you one of these, my two daughters, on [the condition] that you serve me for eight years; but if you complete ten, it will be [as a favor] from you. And I do not wish to put you in difficulty. You will find me, if Allah wills, from among the righteous.\" [Moses] said, \"That is [established] between me and you. Whichever of the two terms I complete - there is no injustice to me, and Allah, over what we say, is Witness.\" And when Moses had completed the term and was traveling with his family, he perceived from the direction of the mount a fire. He said to his family, \"Stay here; indeed, I have perceived a fire. Perhaps I will bring you from there [some] information or burning wood from the fire that you may warm yourselves.\" But when he came to it, he was called from the right side of the valley in a blessed spot - from the tree, \"O Moses, indeed I am Allah, Lord of the worlds.\" And [he was told], \"Throw down your staff.\" But when he saw it writhing as if it was a snake, he turned in flight and did not return. [Allah said], \"O Moses, approach and fear not. Indeed, you are of the secure. Insert your hand into the opening of your garment; it will come out white, without disease. And draw in your arm close to you [as prevention] from fear, for those are two proofs from your Lord to Pharaoh and his establishment. Indeed, they have been a people defiantly disobedient.\" He said, \"My Lord, indeed, I killed from among them someone, and I fear they will kill me. And my brother Aaron is more fluent than me in tongue, so send him with me as support, verifying me. Indeed, I fear that they will deny me.\" [Allah] said, \"We will strengthen your arm through your brother and grant you both supremacy so they will not reach you. [It will be] through Our signs; you and those who follow you will be the predominant.\" But when Moses came to them with Our signs as clear evidences, they said, \"This is not except invented magic, and we have not heard of this [religion] among our forefathers.\" And Moses said, \"My Lord is more knowing [than we or you] of who has come with guidance from Him and to whom will be succession in the home. Indeed, wrongdoers do not succeed.\" And Pharaoh said, \"O eminent ones, I have not known you to have a god other than me. Then ignite for me, O Haman, [a fire] upon the clay and make for me a tower that I may look at the God of Moses. And indeed, I do think he is among the liars.\" And he was arrogant, he and his soldiers, in the land, without right, and they thought that they would not be returned to Us. So We took him and his soldiers and threw them into the sea. So see how was the end of the wrongdoers. And We made them leaders inviting to the Fire, and on the Day of Resurrection they will not be helped. And We caused to overtake them in this world a curse, and on the Day of Resurrection they will be of the despised.

And Pharaoh said, \"Let me kill Moses and let him call upon his Lord. Indeed, I fear that he will change your religion or that he will cause corruption in the land.\" But Moses said, \"Indeed, I have sought refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every arrogant one who does not believe in the Day of Account.\" And a believing man from the family of Pharaoh who concealed his faith said, \"Do you kill a man [merely] because he says, 'My Lord is Allah' while he has brought you clear proofs from your Lord? And if he should be lying, then upon him is [the consequence of] his lie; but if he should be truthful, there will strike you some of what he promises you. Indeed, Allah does not guide one who is a transgressor and a liar. O my people, sovereignty is yours today, [your being] dominant in the land. But who would protect us from the punishment of Allah if it came to us?\" Pharaoh said, \"I do not show you except what I see, and I do not guide you except to the way of right conduct.\" And he who believed said, \"O my people, indeed I fear for you [a fate] like the day of the companies - Like the custom of the people of Noah and of 'Aad and Thamud and those after them. And Allah wants no injustice for [His] servants. And O my people, indeed I fear for you the Day of Calling - The Day you will turn your backs fleeing; there is not for you from Allah any protector. And whoever Allah leaves astray - there is not for him any guide. And Joseph had already come to you before with clear proofs, but you remained in doubt of that which he brought to you, until when he died, you said, 'Never will Allah send a messenger after him.' Thus does Allah leave astray he who is a transgressor and skeptic.\" Those who dispute concerning the signs of Allah without an authority having come to them - great is hatred [of them] in the sight of Allah and in the sight of those who have believed. Thus does Allah seal over every heart [belonging to] an arrogant tyrant. And Pharaoh said, \"O Haman, construct for me a tower that I might reach the ways - The ways into the heavens - so that I may look at the deity of Moses; but indeed, I think he is a liar.\" And thus was made attractive to Pharaoh the evil of his deed, and he was averted from the [right] way. And the plan of Pharaoh was not except in ruin. And he who believed said, \"O my people, follow me, I will guide you to the way of right conduct. O my people, this worldly life is only [temporary] enjoyment, and indeed, the Hereafter - that is the home of [permanent] settlement. Whoever does an evil deed will not be recompensed except by the like thereof; but whoever does righteousness, whether male or female, while he is a believer - those will enter Paradise, being given provision therein without account. And O my people, how is it that I invite you to salvation while you invite me to the Fire? You invite me to disbelieve in Allah and associate with Him that of which I have no knowledge, and I invite you to the Exalted in Might, the Perpetual Forgiver. Assuredly, that to which you invite me has no [response to a] supplication in this world or in the Hereafter; and indeed, our return is to Allah, and indeed, the transgressors will be companions of the Fire. And you will remember what I [now] say to you, and I entrust my affair to Allah. Indeed, Allah is Seeing of [His] servants.\" So Allah protected him from the evils they plotted, and the people of Pharaoh were enveloped by the worst of punishment - The Fire, they are exposed to it morning and evening. And the Day the Hour appears [it will be said], \"Make the people of Pharaoh enter the severest punishment.\" ","surah":40,"ayah":"24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46"},{"verses":"And certainly did We send Moses with Our signs to Pharaoh and his establishment, and he said, \"Indeed, I am the messenger of the Lord of the worlds.\" But when he brought them Our signs, at once they laughed at them. And We showed them not a sign except that it was greater than its sister, and We seized them with affliction that perhaps they might return [to faith]. And they said [to Moses], \"O magician, invoke for us your Lord by what He has promised you. Indeed, we will be guided.\" But when We removed from them the affliction, at once they broke their word. And Pharaoh called out among his people; he said, \"O my people, does not the kingdom of Egypt belong to me, and these rivers flowing beneath me; then do you not see? Or am I [not] better than this one who is insignificant and hardly makes himself clear? Then why have there not been placed upon him bracelets of gold or come with him the angels in conjunction?\" So he bluffed his people, and they obeyed him. Indeed, they were [themselves] a people defiantly disobedient [of Allah]. And when they angered Us, We took retribution from them and drowned them all. And We made them a precedent and an example for the later peoples. And when the son of Mary was presented as an example, immediately your people laughed aloud. And they said, \"Are your gods better, or is he?\" They did not present the comparison except for [mere] argument. But, [in fact], they are a people prone to dispute. Jesus was not but a servant upon whom We bestowed favor, and We made him an example for the Children of Israel. And if We willed, We could have made [instead] of you angels succeeding [one another] on the earth. And indeed, Jesus will be [a sign for] knowledge of the Hour, so be not in doubt of it, and follow Me. This is a straight path. And never let Satan avert you. Indeed, he is to you a clear enemy. And when Jesus brought clear proofs, he said, \"I have come to you with wisdom and to make clear to you some of that over which you differ, so fear Allah and obey me. Indeed, Allah is my Lord and your Lord, so worship Him. This is a straight path.\" But the denominations from among them differed [and separated], so woe to those who have wronged from the punishment of a painful Day. Are they waiting except for the Hour to come upon them suddenly while they perceive not? Close friends, that Day, will be enemies to each other, except for the righteous [To whom Allah will say], \"O My servants, no fear will there be concerning you this Day, nor will you grieve, [You] who believed in Our verses and were Muslims. Enter Paradise, you and your kinds, delighted.\" Circulated among them will be plates and vessels of gold. And therein is whatever the souls desire and [what] delights the eyes, and you will abide therein eternally. And that is Paradise which you are made to inherit for what you used to do. For you therein is much fruit from which you will eat. Indeed, the criminals will be in the punishment of Hell, abiding eternally. It will not be allowed to subside for them, and they, therein, are in despair. And We did not wrong them, but it was they who were the wrongdoers. And they will call, \"O Malik, let your Lord put an end to us!\" He will say, \"Indeed, you will remain.\" We had certainly brought you the truth, but most of you, to the truth, were averse. Or have they devised [some] affair? But indeed, We are devising [a plan]. Or do they think that We hear not their secrets and their private conversations? Yes, [We do], and Our messengers are with them recording. Say, [O Muhammad], \"If the Most Merciful had a son, then I would be the first of [his] worshippers.\" Exalted is the Lord of the heavens and the earth, Lord of the Throne, above what they describe. So leave them to converse vainly and amuse themselves until they meet their Day which they are promised. And it is Allah who is [the only] deity in the heaven, and on the earth [the only] deity.
